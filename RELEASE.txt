Future release notes go here...

When a new release is about to be tagged, version and release information needs to be updated in a few places.

Once the required features in gromacs-gmxapi have been merged to its master branch, update the several lines in
.travis.yml to reference the gromacs-gmxapi release archive instead of master or a development branch.

Similarly, update the `gromacs_url` embedded in setup.py

After merging the gmxapi development branch to master and before tagging the release, 
update setup.py so that it writes a version.py file with `release = True`.

Once the release is tagged and any last-minute essentials are cherry-picked to the refreshed development branch,
bump the version in the development branch in CMakeLists.txt _and_ in setup.py. If / when feature branches
require new libgmxapi features, `find_package(gmxapi...` can be updated in `src/gmx/core/CMakeLists.txt`. While
we have the package version check set to REQUIRED, this is probably an immediate update. Sometime after 0.1.0,
though, we hope we can have some backwards compatibility and leave the libgmxapi version more flexible.
